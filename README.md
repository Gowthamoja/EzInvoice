#  EzInvoice: Invoice Management System

---

## Project Title and Concept

**EzInvoice** is a web-based **Invoice Management System** designed to streamline the process of creating, tracking, and managing invoices. 

Built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and EJS as the templating engine), the application provides a user-friendly interface for businesses to handle their billing needs efficiently. The core concept is to provide a complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** interface for invoice records stored in a MongoDB database.

##  Features Implemented in This Version (Mongoose/Express Frontend)

This current version provides the essential scaffolding for a full-featured application, with the following core functionalities implemented:

### Invoice CRUD Operations 

* **Create:** Users can access a dedicated "**New Invoice**" form (`/invoices/new`) to input all necessary details (invoice number, dates, bill-from/bill-to info, line items, totals, etc.) and save a new invoice to the MongoDB database.

* **Read (Index):** The main dashboard (`/invoices`) displays a comprehensive list of all saved invoices in a table format, showing key details like invoice number, client name, total amount, due date, and status. It also includes dynamic summary cards for **Total Outstanding**, **Total Paid**, and **Total Unpaid** amounts.

* **Read (Show):** Users can view the complete, detailed breakdown of a single invoice, including all line items, totals, notes, and payment terms (`/invoices/:id`).

* **Update:** A dedicated "**Edit Invoice**" page (`/invoices/:id/edit`) allows users to modify all existing invoice details and save the changes.

* **Delete:** Invoices can be permanently removed from the system via a delete button with a confirmation modal on the show page.

### Core Functionality 

* **Dynamic Calculations (Client-Side):** The New and Edit forms feature client-side JavaScript logic to automatically calculate:
    * Individual Item Totals (Quantity \* Unit Price + Tax).
    * The overall Subtotal, Tax Total, and final Grand Total for the invoice.

* **Invoice Status and Display:** Each invoice clearly displays its status (**Paid** or **Unpaid**) with distinct color badges on the index and show pages.

* **UI/UX:** A clean, responsive user interface built with **Bootstrap** is used across the application.

* **Data Persistence:** Data is stored in a **MongoDB** database, connected using **Mongoose**.

##  Future Improvements Planned (Backend Integration)

Future development will focus on building a more robust and complete backend system, including:

### Security & Authorization 

* **Full User Authentication and Authorization:** Implement complete sign-up (`/signup`) and login (`/login`) functionality using secure techniques (e.g., **Passport.js** with local or social strategies).

* **Access Control:** Restrict access to invoice management routes (`/invoices`) to authenticated users only.

* **Sessions:** Implement user sessions or token-based authorization.

### Backend Logic Refinements 

* **Server-Side Invoice Calculation and Validation:**
    * Move the financial calculation logic (item totals, grand totals) from client-side JavaScript to the backend (**Mongoose pre-save middleware** or **Express route handlers**) for security and reliability.
    * Add schema-level validation to the Mongoose models to ensure data integrity (e.g., required fields, numeric range checks).

* **Advanced Filtering and Sorting:** Implement server-side logic to allow users to filter the main invoice list by criteria such as status (Paid/Unpaid), client name, due date range, and amount.

* **Error and Success Handling (Flash Messages):** Integrate a mechanism (like `connect-flash`) to display transient success or error messages to the user after form submissions (e.g., "Invoice created successfully!" or "Error deleting invoice.").
